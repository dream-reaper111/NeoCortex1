## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities to **security@neocortex.ai**. Include a
description of the issue, the affected endpoints or components, and any proof
of concept material you can share safely. We acknowledge reports within two
business days and aim to provide a triage update within five business days.
Coordinated disclosure is encouraged; we will work with you on reasonable
release timelines so mitigations are in place before public disclosure.

For sensitive payloads, request our PGP key via the email address above.
